    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Iulian Furtuna is a multidisciplinary artist whose career spans acting, mime, puppetry, theater direction, and filmmaking. From his early days with Footsbarn Theater to directing award-winning short films like <em>Les Colocataires</em> for Canal+, Iulian has consistently pushed the boundaries of storytelling. His recent co-directed documentary, <em>Le Peuple des Nuages</em>, explores the intersection of culture and nature. A pioneer in 3D and holographic art, Iulian also shares his expertise as a teacher, having taught animation, drama, and film at institutions like EICAR Paris, RSAMD Glasgow, and ArtCollege Edinburgh.</p>
